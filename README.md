## Overview

xPlorer is a powerful NVDA add-on that makes File Explorer operations faster and more accessible. It provides quick access to common and advanced file management tasks such as compressing to ZIP, safe renaming (with separate name/extension fields), reading file/folder/drive sizes, copying filenames to clipboard, copying file contents without opening them, and much more.

## Hot Keys

- **NVDA+Alt+X** → Open the **xPlorer Context Menu**  
  Instantly access all xPlorer functions from one convenient submenu.

- **NVDA+Shift+Z** → **Compress selected items to ZIP**  
  Compress one or multiple selected files/folders into a ZIP archive automatically.

- **NVDA+Shift+C** → **Copy selected file/folder names to clipboard**  
  Copy the names of all selected items for easy pasting elsewhere.

- **NVDA+Shift+F2** → **Rename selected file safely**  
  Opens a dialog with separate fields for filename and extension — preventing accidental deletion or corruption.

- **NVDA+Shift+V** → **Copy file content without opening**  
  Copy the full text content of supported files (≤10 MB each) directly to clipboard.  
  Supported extensions: `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.xml`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.md`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.cfg`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.h`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.pl`, `.sh`, `.bat`, `.ps1`

- **NVDA+Shift+I** → **Invert selection**  
  Quickly toggle between currently selected and unselected items.

- **NVDA+Shift+X** → **Say size**  
  Announces the total size of selected files, folders, or drives (supports multiple selections).

## Features (Toggle in NVDA → Preferences → Settings → xPlorer)

- Automatically select the first item in a folder
- Announce **“Empty Folder”** when entering an empty directory
- Suppress announcement of **DirectUIHWND** class (checked by default)

## Robocopy – Smart & Reliable File Operations

Robocopy is far superior to standard Windows copy/move:

- Skips files that are already identical
- Resumes automatically after interruption (perfect for large transfers)
- Ideal for moving or copying huge amounts of data without ever starting over

## Mirror Backup with Schedule

Set up fully automatic **mirror backups** that run on your schedule:

- Every few minutes, hours, days, or weeks
- Uses Robocopy to keep the destination folder **100% identical** to the source
- Runs silently in the background — no manual work required

A simple, reliable, hands-free backup solution.
