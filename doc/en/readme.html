<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>xPlorer is a tool designed to provide easier access to File Explorer operations.  
The latest version includes features for managing files and folders, such as compressing items into a ZIP, renaming files with a dedicated window that separates the filename and extension to prevent accidental deletion, reading the size of files, folders, or drives, and copying selected file and folder names to the clipboard etc.</p>

<br>

<h2>Hot Keys</h2>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+ALT+X : Open xPlorer Context Menu</strong></p>

<p>Select a file or folder and open the context menu. This submenu consolidates all xPlorer functions in one place, allowing you to access any feature immediately for convenience and speed.<br>

<br>


<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+Z : Compress selected items to ZIP</strong></p>

<p>Select the files or select all, then press the shortcut key.  
The selected items will be automatically compressed into a ZIP file.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+C : Copy selected file and folder names to clipboard</strong></p>

<p>Select the desired files (one or multiple) or select all, then press the shortcut key.  
All selected file and folder names will be copied to the clipboard for pasting into a text editor.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+F2 : Rename selected file</strong></p>

<p>Select a file and press the shortcut key.  
A window will open with separate fields for the filename and file extension.  
You can edit the name or extension easily.  
Press Enter to close the window.  
Only the name or extension will be updated automatically.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+V : Copy Content</strong></p>

<p>Select a text editor file (that already contains content) or choose multiple files (each no larger than 10&nbsp;MB), then press the shortcut key.<br>
You can copy all of the contents without opening the files, avoiding multiple steps when working with several documents.<br>
Support file extension: .txt, .rtf, .py, .js, .html, .css, .xml, .json, .csv, .md, .ini, .conf, .cfg, .java, .cpp, .c, .h, .php, .rb, .pl, .sh, .bat, .ps1</p>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+I : Invert Selection</strong></p>

<p>Select a file or folder, then press NVDA+Shift+I to invert the selection, highlighting the unselected files and folders instead. Pressing it again will toggle the selection back and forth.<br>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+X : Say size</strong></p>

<p>Select a text file in the editor (one that already contains content), or select multiple files (each no larger than 10 MB).<br>
Press the shortcut key to copy all of their contents without opening the files, removing the need for multiple steps when working with several documents.<br>
In the latest version, users can also select multiple files or folders to view the total size.</p>
