<h2>What's new in the latest version?</h2>

<br>

<p>Create File<br>
<p>Edit new keyboard shortcuts Make it more convenient to use and improve the Say Size function<br>

<br><br>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>xPlorer is a tool designed to provide easier access to File Explorer operations.  
The latest version includes features for managing files and folders, such as compressing items into a ZIP, renaming files with a dedicated window that separates the filename and extension to prevent accidental deletion, reading the size of files, folders, or drives, and copying selected file and folder names to the clipboard etc.</p>

<br>

<h2>Hot Keys</h2>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+X : Open xPlorer Context Menu</strong></p>

<p>Select a file or folder and open the context menu. This submenu consolidates all xPlorer functions in one place, allowing you to access any feature immediately for convenience and speed.<br>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+Z Single Tap : Say size</strong></p>

<p>Select a text file in the editor (one that already contains content), or select multiple files (each no larger than 10 MB).<br>
Press the shortcut key to copy all of their contents without opening the files, removing the need for multiple steps when working with several documents.<br>
In the latest version, users can also select multiple files or folders to view the total size.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+Z Double Tap : Compress selected items to ZIP</strong></p>

<p>Select the files or select all, then press the shortcut key.  
The selected items will be automatically compressed into a ZIP file.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+C : Copy selected file and folder names to clipboard</strong></p>

<p>Select the desired files (one or multiple) or select all, then press the shortcut key.  
All selected file and folder names will be copied to the clipboard for pasting into a text editor.</p>

<br>


<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+C Double Tab : Copy address bar in File Explorer</strong></p>
<p>When you are in the folder whose path you want to copy, simply press the shortcut key double-tap to copy the address bar directly, instead of opening it with Ctrl+L, which is faster.<br>


<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+V Single Tap : Copy Content</strong></p>

<p>Select a text editor file (that already contains content) or choose multiple files (each no larger than 10&nbsp;MB), then press the shortcut key.<br>
You can copy all of the contents without opening the files, avoiding multiple steps when working with several documents.<br>
Support file extension: .txt, .rtf, .py, .js, .html, .css, .xml, .json, .csv, .md, .ini, .conf, .cfg, .java, .cpp, .c, .h, .php, .rb, .pl, .sh, .bat, .ps1</p>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+V Double Tap : Invert Selection</strong></p>

<p>Select a file or folder, then press NVDA+Shift+I to invert the selection, highlighting the unselected files and folders instead. Pressing it again will toggle the selection back and forth.<br>

<br>

<p><strong>• NVDA+Shift+F2 : Rename selected file</strong></p>

<p>Select a file and press the shortcut key.  
A window will open with separate fields for the filename and file extension.  
You can edit the name or extension easily.  
Press Enter to close the window.  
Only the name or extension will be updated automatically.</p>

<br>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Additionally, features from previous versions can be enabled or disabled via:  
NVDA menu → Preferences → Settings → xPlorer</p>

<br>

<ul>
<li>Automatically select the first item</li>
<li>Announce 'Empty Folder' when entering an empty folder</li>
<li>Suppress announcement of DirectUIHWND class, checked</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<p>Create File<br>
<p>While focused in File Explorer at the location where you want to create new files, open the xPlorer context menu and select Create File. A dialog will appear allowing you to specify the desired file name and extension. You can freely set the number of files to be created. The feature supports a wide range of text editor and coding file formats.<br>


<br>

<p><strong>Robocopy</strong> is a command used to "move" or "copy" folders and files from one place to another, smarter than the normal Windows copy.</p>

<p>It won’t copy the same files again if they are already identical.</p>

<p>Even if there are many or very large files, Robocopy can continue from where it left off if the copying was interrupted.</p>

<p>Simply put, it’s perfect for when you want to “move a large amount of data” without having to start over every time.</p>

<br>

<h3>Mirror Backup with Schedule</h3>

<p>This feature lets you set up automatic <strong>mirror backups</strong> that run at your chosen time — every few minutes, hours, days, or weeks.</p>

<p>When the time comes, Robocopy will automatically back up the source folder to the destination folder, creating a mirror copy that matches the latest data.</p>

<p>It’s a simple and reliable way to keep your files updated without doing it manually every time.</p>

<br>

<h3>TXT to Floder</h3>

<p>Select a file that contains a list in .txt format, then press NVDA+Alt+X and choose the TXT to Folder function.
xPlorer will then create a subfolder named after the .txt file, and inside it, each list item will be created as a separate folder.<br>
